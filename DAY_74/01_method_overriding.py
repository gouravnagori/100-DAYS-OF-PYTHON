# Method Overriding in Python

# Method overriding is a powerful feature in object-oriented programming
# that allows you to redefine a method in a derived class. The method in
# the derived class is said to override the method in the base class. When
# you create an instance of the derived class and call the overridden
# method, the version of the method in the derived class is executed,
# rather than the version in the base class.

# In Python, method overriding is a way to customize the behavior of a
# class based on its specific needs. For example, consider the following
# base class:

# class Shape:
#     def area(self):
#         pass

# In this base class, the area method is defined, but does not have any
# implementation. If you want to create a derived class that represents a
# circle, you can override the area method and provide an implementation
# that calculates the area of a circle:

class Shape:
    def __init__(self,x,y):
       self.x = x
       self.y = y
    def area(self):
        return self.x * self.y   

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self,radius):
        super().__init__(radius,radius)
    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * super().area()       

rec = Shape(3,4)    
print(rec.area())

cir = Circle(1)
print(cir.area())
