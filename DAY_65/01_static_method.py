# Static methods in Python are methods that belong to a class rather
# than an instance of the class. They are defined using the
# @staticmethod decorator and do not have access to the instance of
# the class (i.e. self). They are called on the class itself, not on an
# instance of the class. Static methods are often used to create utility
# functions that don't need access to instance data.

class Math:
    @staticmethod
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b                                    
                                    
result = Math.add(1, 2)                                    
print(result) # Output: 3                                    

# In this example, the add method is a static method of the Math
# class. It takes two parameters a and b and returns their sum. The
# method can be called on the class itself, without the need to create
# an instance of the class.


class math:
    def __init__(self,num):
        self.num = num

    def addnum(self,n):
        self.num += n 
    
    @staticmethod
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b

a=math(5) 
print(a.num)  
a.addnum(6)   

print(a.num)     

print(a.add(3,44)) 
# or you can call via this also
print(math.add(22,5))
