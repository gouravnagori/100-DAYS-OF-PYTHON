# Getters

# Getters in Python are methods that are used to access the values
# of an object's properties. They are used to return the value of a
# specific property, and are typically defined using the @property
# decorator. Here is an example of a simple class with a getter
# method:

# class MyClass:
#   def __ init __ (self, value):
#       self ._ value = value

# @property
# def value(self):
#   return self ._ value

# In this example, the MyClass class has a single property, _value,
# which is initialized in the init method. The value method is
# defined as a getter using the @property decorator, and is used to
# return the value of the _value property.

# To use the getter, we can create an instance of the MyClass class,
# and then access the value property as if it were an attribute:

# >>> obj = MyClass(10)
# >>> obj.value
# 10

class Myclass:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
    def show(self):
        print(f'the value is {self.value}')
    
    @property
    def ten_times(self):
        return 10*self.value
    
obj1 = Myclass(10)
# obj1.ten_times = 87 it throw error
print(obj1.ten_times)
obj1.show()





# Setters

# It is important to note that the getters do not take any
# parameters and we cannot set the value through getter
# method.For that we need setter method which can be added by
# decorating method with @property_name.setter

# Here is an example of a class with both getter and setter:

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self._value = value

    @property
    def value(self):
        return self._value

    @value.setter
    def value(self, new_value):
        self ._value = new_value

# We can use setter method like this:

obj = MyClass(10)
obj.value = 21
print(obj.value)


# In conclusion, getters are a convenient way to access the values
# of an object's properties, while keeping the internal
# representation of the property hidden. This can be useful for
# encapsulation and data validation.
